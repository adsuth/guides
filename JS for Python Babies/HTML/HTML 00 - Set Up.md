# HTML 00 - Setup

There isn't much to setup for HTML, but there are a few extensions I'd recommend for a better workflow.

### Live Server

The Live Server extension allows you to easily create a local instance of your site on localhost (an example of the URL is shown below).

http://localhost:5000/

The site will be updated and refreshed if and when you save a file, meaning you can see your changes in real time.

### Auto Rename Tag

This extension is a helpful utility that will automatically change the closing (or opening) tag when you change the other.
