# HTML 01 - Introduction

### What is HTML

**HTML** stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**, it's used to provide the scaffolding of a website through the use of elements (or tags). It's one of the three core building blocks of a website, the others being CSS and Javascript.

A common analogy for the roles of the three are that,

- HTML is the skeleton of the site

- CSS is the looks

- JS is the brains
