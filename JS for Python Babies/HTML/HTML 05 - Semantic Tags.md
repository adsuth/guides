# HTML 05 - Semantic Tags

**Semantic Tags** are exactly what they sound like: they're more human readable tags that are synonymous with other tags, generally `<div>`.

For example, the `<header>` tag is just a `<div>`, but positioned at **the top of the parent**. Keep in mind that **semantic tags alone will not change the layout of the HTML, they only exist to make whoever's reading your HTML have a general idea of the layout.**
